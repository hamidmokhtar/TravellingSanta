
1- Clustering.py: clusters the cities to smaller "States" close to an average density.
2- TravellingSantaProblem.py: Solves problems for given input. first solve for each cluster, then for States. 
3- CombineTSPs.py: uses the solutions to construct a TSP for all cities (original problem). 
4- ACO_v3.py: ant colony approach to solve Travelling Santa Problem.
