# A solution for Travelling Santa Problem

This is a set of Python codes for solving the Travelling Santa Problem originally posted on Kaggle website(https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/overview).  

1. Clustering.py: clusters the cities to smaller "States" close to an average density.
2. TravellingSantaProblem.py: Solves problems for given input. first solve for each cluster, then for States. 
3. CombineTSPs.py: uses the solutions to construct a TSP for all cities (original problem). 
4. ACO_v3.py: ant colony approach to solve Travelling Santa Problem.
